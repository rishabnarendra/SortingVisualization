# SortingVisualization

This React application simulates the sorting process of different famous sorting algorithms like selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort. I built this application to better understand some sorting patterns. I hope you can enjoy playing around with it!
This project was inspired by Clement Mihailescu, a former Google employee. This version is my implementation of his program.
